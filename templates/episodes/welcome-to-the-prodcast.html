<p>How  selling a grilled cheese sandwhich landed me in Product Management.</p>
<p>We're James & James, current Product Managers at Freelancer.com</p>
<p>In this episode, we detail how we both ended up becoming Product Managers, and a brief explanation of what product management can mean at different companies!</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Hello everybody welcome to the prodcast. I'm here with James--</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> That's me.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> And I'm also James. And we are both product managers at freelancer.com, which is - for those of you haven't heard of it. It's a sort of a tech company that started in Sydney. And it's been sort of cracking on for eight years now, is it?</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Yes. 2009, January 2009 is the official sort of launch date I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Yes. It's an online marketplace for jobs and services. Yes, so look you know James and I are sitting here because we thought, "hey we've been working in tech for a while now and we've met some super super interesting people with some really really valuable knowledge and backgrounds and different skillsets and you know every time we speak to them, I open again, there's just--</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> We thought you know why don't we sort of set up a format where we can invite these people on so that they can share it with a broader community. And podcast, that's.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> It's going to be pretty casual, it's going to be pretty informal. You know, we encourage you to get involved in whichever way you want, reach out to us on any of the socials, or find our contact details on our website, and get involved. But, yes we're going to do something just for this sort of first episode zero if you wish.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Look, we thought we'd, you know, again as a starter do a bit of - have a bit of a conversation on product management. I think not everyone knows what that is even. And which is fat because they mean different things in a lot of different companies. And not every tech company even has - they don't call them product managers at least.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> And it's also very differently defined even if it means the same thing, the roles and responsibilities change so vastly among different companies, it's an interesting role in that sense.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Absolutely, look maybe James you want to try and do your best to explain or like product management in a nutshell. At least what it is for us and how we see it generally applied in tech companies.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Yes, sure. It's a buzzword that I hear a lot but usually the product manager is the CEO of their product and I think that's something that differs a product manager from a project manager. Where a project manager typically is the guy managing staff or managing the project, a product manager really owns one specific product and grows with that product. So, for me a product manager is really more than just a project manager in the sense that they know the data, they know the engineering, they know the people, and they know every aspect of their product.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> It can be science and the legal aspect of their product.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Absolutely every part of it. Just like a C.E.O. knows their business, it's super important to as a product manager know and have a grasp on absolutely everything. So that's an interesting thing because it means as a product manager you kind of have to have a whole tool belt of skills you can't just be a people person, or a HR person, or an engineer. You have to be very wide.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Absolutely. You know one thing that you will find though is that a lot of product managers will lean quite heavily towards--</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Oh absolutely. I mean again there's no one answer to any of this.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> So you definitely need a good sort of base level of everything.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> I mean certainly at Freelancer even you know where we are now is there's such a - even in the same job title, there is such a broad variety, some people are very, very much coming from a data science, data heavy background. Some are coming from an engineering background where their strengths are more dealing with engineering architecture and those sort of problems. There are some which come from a UX UI background, and some come from game development, and you know all these different skills and that's why as a product management team, we are able to work so effectively, because we can share some of the those skills around. But in a general sense I'd say the product manager is quite a broad skill set to have and if you don't have a broad set of skills you perhaps may struggle a bit.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> So how did you become a product manager James?</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Yes. It's again such a bizarre story really. In 2013, I was working on my startup and it was sort of fizzling out I guess you could say. It was an idea we had and we all thought it was a great idea as everyone does when they start a startup.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Yes, I think it's kind of what separates a start up from a small business. </p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> It's like you have a vision of like billions of dollars and it just--</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Yes, yes basically. Anyway so that was plotting along and one of my co-founders Nicholas, he came to work at Freelancer and he said, "Boys, boys this is so much fun you got to jump on board. Like, the startup's been great, we've learnt a lot but let's go get real jobs basically.‚Äù And at the time, Freelancer, was quite a different company to be honest. Freelancer was very much an engineering company with a bunch of data scientists and growth hackers on top of that. So much so, sort of separated out that the growth hackers and the data scientists sat in one office and across the road, was the engineering team and the finance team, and the rest. It was just kind of the way that naturally the teams were spread into engineering and growth as two separate teams. And as we grew as a company we started assigning some of these growth people to groups of engineering, to focus on a specific product. So, as a very clear example the memberships team, which is a team which is so big for us today still was one of the first that we had a dedicated growth person sort of leading that team, and some dedicated engineering resources just for memberships. Same kind of thing happened with contests, one of our products and sort of slowly started to develop in this way. When we hired our first actual product manager was a big, sort of step forward and they were--</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> How many years ago is that?</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> This was mid-2014, I want to say. It was right after we moved from our Jones Bay Wharf office to our World Square office. We hired our first product manager. And actually we hired a couple at a very similar time, couple of very good product managers who I still look up to today. And they brought along to this company, the idea of really breaking into product groups and doing agile and all these kind of more traditional kind of product team, kind of stuff. And so at that time, I was sort of put in charge of - I was in more or less in our marketing team, what we call the acquisitions team, and I was put in charge of a SEO. And before that I'd been doing, planning page optimization, and Facebook ads and just a bunch of sort of odd growth jobs, if you will. So` then I was finally put in charge of just SEO and I was given some engineers and stuff like that. And then, I don't remember the circumstances exactly but our product manager for mobile moved on to another company and someone just put up their hand, I think and said it's alright JP will be good at that. So I landed myself three teams, four teams, I think overnight.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> What were the four teams?</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Android, iOS, mobile web and API or something like that.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Oh, really?</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Just, yes. Like I don't even remember exactly. But I was I was just thrown in it. It was like twelve guys or something like this at the time. And they said okay, you've had some experience in building mobile apps before with your start-up, so over to you now. And that's basically, it's kind of gone from there and picked up and dropped various parts of that since then but I've been more or less product manager for mobile, sometimes depending on who I'm talking to I'm the head of mobile at freelancer.com for a couple years now. So it's just kind of wears out. Basically, you could say I was a growth hacker to start with. My job title on my business card is data scientist. But we didn't really have that strong of a data science team the way we do today. Our data science team today is much more of a data heavy analytics kind of thing, but back then data scientist meant what we'd today, we'd call growth hacker and I hate that phrase, but it's basically what it was. What about you what you Sam?</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Wow. Probably maybe even slightly less conventional. Not that that was a conventional way of--</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> I mean I hear stories similar to that all the time particularly among young companies where you've got a smart guy in charge of a team and suddenly, you grow to a certain size and you need to call them a product manager so they just kind of get put into it naturally, I think it's a natural progression and in some ways.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Basically my pathway was - it was a very sort of random series of events that led me into product management. In fact there was never a time in my life even where I sat down I was like - well at least not until I was already doing it, I was like, I want to work in tech even. But I left school and I was like, wanted to save money to go to Europe as everyone does, and I somehow ended up in an ungodly door to door sales cult basically almost. But you know what, it was kind of like - it was good because it was hard, and it was difficult, but you learn how to hustle which is again another buzzword that makes everyone cringe but, there's a reason why it's a buzzword.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> It's true though, yes.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> It is a thing.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Such a big part of product management is hustling.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Yes, absolutely. And again sales as well in general, it's you have to sell ideas upwards and downwards as a product manager. You know you need to convince whoever your reporting to that you're headed in the right direction, obviously once you're sure of it, but that that's the right way to go and you have to stand by your beliefs in the product and at the same time you need to have your engineers on board, and you need to have them motivated with the product. Which is definitely where I think that came from. But yes, basically look I did that for a year, and then I ended up leaving that and I ended up interning at Uber. And actually you know what--</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> What sort of?</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Okay, yes. I know what you are going to ask.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> I'm just curious because that was kind of in the early days of Uber in a sort of way, particularly in Australia. It was right after they've launched in Australia, right?</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Before Uber exit launch, I joined a week before, Uber exit launch, I think it was 2014 but actually it's kind of a funny story. They wanted like a hustler, that's what they put on job ad. I actually will admit I had no idea what Uber was when I applied for the job, but I was applying to loads of stuff and you know my thing was, I just applied at everything and then pick the best one out of what you get. Anyway look, they called me in for an interview and before they called me into an interview they said, "Look, you know you are a hustler, you come with a sales background, could you send us a clip of you selling something?"</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> I just thought, "Okay sure.‚Äù So I made a little clip of me selling a grilled cheese sandwich.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Was it on white bread? Cut in the middle?</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> I can't remember exactly.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Did you actually cook the sandwich and hold it up for?</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> No, I didn't cook. I ate one before I did it so that I forbid [inaudible 13:09] I was like--</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Probably [inaudible 13:10]</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Yes, exactly. But no, I was like no, okay I'll sell a grilled cheese sandwich and again, if I had known who Uber was, I'd probably would have been less boldly because I was would have wanted it a lot more.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> That's funny too though.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> I did that and they had it and they thought it was funny and they liked it obviously so I went in for a couple more interviews. I ended up getting, sort of an intern role on the operations team. So by the way at this time Uber was a company of eight people in Sydney--</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Just context, do you know how many there are in Australia now? On the order of a hundred like?</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong>  At least I think it depends --</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> They are quite because they've got offices in all sorts of areas.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> They do. It's a lot, it's a lot.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Okay, continue.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> But basically, I did that for eight months, and it was an incredible experience. I mean really doing that -- so we were doing driver operations in Sydney, and the Sydney team is awesome. And you know they're really really solid group of people, really smart guys and it really is sort of interesting the way they tackle problems. You know it's funny because obviously -- okay well -- first I was an intern, so it's not like I will be exposed to any of that sort of big stuff that--</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Oh, you can't be touching the big stuff.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Yes, but seriously, though but the other hand there was eight of us and you know, I just, again not trying to rush defence but I think maybe the satellite offices are quite different cultures and environments to San Fran but it just, it didn‚Äôt--</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> I know where you are going with this.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Now the stuff that's going on now it just, I don‚Äôt know, it didn't really pay me, [inaudible 15:03] what we were doing at the time. But look anyway without getting sidetracked I did that for eight months and I loved it, and I actually ended up starting my own little business with a friend, we were running it out of his kitchen. Basically what we were doing was, we were buying people's job applications. So CVs. So basically companies that did high volumes of low level recruiting year around places like, I don‚Äôt know McDonald's, of not that - sorry they were not a partner of a little start up but yes, businesses like that--</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> That would be an incredible partnership and a good start.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Well, basically we bought these CVs and then we would sell them to educational institutions, legally by the way where they put disclaimers on the job ads which allowed us to use this information for this--</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> That is more or less a recruiter, right?</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Yes. Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> They don‚Äôt do much different, I think.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> For this specific purpose not yes--</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> I'm not downplaying it, but a lot of recruiters do that.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> It was really simple. Basically we started buying literally thousands and thousands of applications for I don't know for something like fifty cents each and we was selling them for five dollars each to these applications, and all our business was, was a middleman where we were trading these CVs. And it was great for a little while, we made like 40k in profit, because we had no expenses right, we were running it out of my mate's kitchen. It cost us like eleven hundred dollars to register the business.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Not even that much, I don't think, is it?</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> There was like, I don't know, there was some other fee. But it was literally like there was no expenses and we never bought CVs unless we already had sold them, so yes. It was easy it was great we did that for a while. I went away to Israel just as it got started and went on a bit of a holiday and it all fell apart, which is weird but shit happens but I probably wouldn't approach like that again. I think we knew that it wasn't that sort of sustainable business because ultimately we were offering no value. We were a middleman who is keeping two parties who had no idea who each other were at arm‚Äôs length. And whilst that was great at the time it's not a sustainable business model to be a middleman that just offers no value other than knowing the two parties. So yes, look we really, we weren't that upset about it and then yet my at my next job was Freelancer, I started in a marking sort of role.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Yes, because we brought you on right after we launched local jobs</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> And I distinctly remember your first day. Why don‚Äôt you tell people, what you were doing you know when you when you hired or what you were hired to do.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> You know what my first job was basically the process that an advanced algorithm is supposed to do on Freelancer or what it does do for our online marketplace, where you know you post your project and you add some skills and we do a lot of stuff to find the best freelancer and match you with them. But yes I guess it wasn't really like that for local jobs because it was brand new and there was no liquidity--</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> We didn't have the dataset either to figure out, you know there's no history in the freelancers‚Äô profiles, and we can't tell whether they can be good at cleaning your car.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> We did not even have, when I started have location data for our users.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Okay, so you were brought in to do what?</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> I was brought in - I think like the long term sort of vision was that we were going to have this big - we have a product at freelancer called recruiter which is basically a concierge service so you post your project, and then someone from freelancer will reach out to you and say, "Hey how's it going this is your brief." Confirm a bunch of details with you and then go do the process for you of finding the best freelancer, and sort of guide you through it. And that's what I was supposed to be the original person doing that for local jobs, and I think there was a vision of sort of me getting a team of people around to do it, which we have--</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Which we did actually.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Yes, we did do that.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> But very quickly, became far too much volume for you to do--</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> So, I was literally calling - imagine if you posted a job for someone to clean your apartment in Sydney. It was literally my job to go and get on the phone with like a ton of cleaners who were in your area, convince them to, [a] sign up to freelancer, which--</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Easier said than done, I reckon.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Well yes because these are businesses, a lot of these businesses were typically paid in cash now that, [a] there was a paper trail so they probably have to start paying tax and [b] there's obviously Freelancer as a marketplace takes a commission as well, so yes.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> And a global marketplace, as well, you just can't cover that.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Oh, yes by the way, this was not just in Sydney, Freelancer is the only company that has launched its local jobs and services product globally. So hundred and something countries at the same time--</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> 243 states and territories and whatever else it is.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Across the world. And people really were posting projects in all of those places. I mean I think you know in the sort of - I can't remember what - in the space of a quarter there was jobs posted in a thousand different cities across one hundred countries.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Just I mean not to get too sidetrack, but what was the most bizarre job you did, no I mean that was a legit job but you needed to hustle to get done. A photographer for six apartments in--</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> No, no. I've got better than that actually, this was in my first couple of weeks. There was a guy he was an investor. Not an investor for Freelancer I don't think but, anyway some guy, he posted a project. He wanted his investment firm, he wanted like the hero image on their website to be a photo from a set and peak of Mount Kosciuszko at dusk. And apparently he'd gone and climbed, sorry no, Mt Everest.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Mount Everest, yes.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> So I'm under playing it, it's [inaudible 21:29] man out of--</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Mount Kosciuszko.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> So he wanted basically, he'd obviously climbed Mount Everest and had a bit of a moment at dusk on the set and peak and seen this incredible thing and thought that really emulates my business but forgotten to take a good quality picture.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Oh, drats.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> So yes, he basically he wanted a local jobs freelancer to climb--</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> But it was like to base camp one or something.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> No way higher, way higher.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> It was like--</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Up the mountain. There's different parts to that. [a] you have--</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> It was the right time of day--</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> You have to get the right weather conditions.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Have all the right gear, get a good shot at the end of that, anyway. Wow.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> So that was a toughie going and reaching out to a bunch of Napoleon [inaudible 22:26]</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> And then you--</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> It's in Nepal, right?</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Nepal yes. And then, local jobs kind of built up and you started really hustling with the engineering side of things, because you were realizing that, that there was features on the product that needed to be built but you were smart enough to realize that to build those you needed to go and get some other team's support right?</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Again like I would preface this by saying, I was the biggest computer dup that you had ever met when I started at Freelancer. Like I didn't know anything really. Look when I started. I was very quickly consumed by the data driven culture that Freelancer has, and Freelancer it's obsessive with data and it's what makes the company tick and obviously as you know an employee of the company you know if that's what everything's revolving around, you become interested in that. And it is a genuinely really interesting thing data science and analysis, that whole space really. Actually you know James, and a group of other friends who were working with us, we had a friend group of like five of us, who all ended up becoming product managers actually, six of us. And--</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Five out of seven are now product managers [crosstalk 23:49]</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Yes. I've sort of developed a bit of an obsession and I started studying this stuff every night when I went home, just on my own asking these guys loads of questions and really really trying to understand the data component of this product, and you know everything from AB testing, to going and extracting my own data, and then being able to visualize that data, and put it into graphs that made sense and went rough and reliable. And then yes, look once I sort of picked up that skill, it was a sort of pretty quick transition, I ended up becoming the product manager of that team. </p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> And you actually joined your group, so the local jobs kind of thing joined my group.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> So, James used to be my boss.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Yes, for a short while.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> It was like three months.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> So the way it kind of panned out is that I was getting, there was just too much work for one product manager and James joined - the local jobs joined my group and I'm cutting a long story short maybe we can talk about it in another episode, but the mobile web portion of the mobile team was getting a little - not quite enough love perhaps. And James showed an interest--</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> To be honest, even before I was the product manager of local jobs I've always thought that mobile web was the most interesting product that I would like to work on. I mean James obviously being you know, the mobile guy at Freelancer, I've now stolen one of his mobile babies but he's still very helpful but we obviously debate very heatedly that mobile and where it's heading and mobile technology--</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> It's actually a great topic for another episode.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Yes, definitely. But look I'm as is James we sort of agree on a lot of stuff, but most stuff even I'm a very big believer in mobile web being the future of mobile and also mobile technology is--</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> I think that's something we can both agree on.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Yes. Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> How we get there is the debate, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Yes, exactly exactly. And you know what like mobile web technology is getting really interesting--</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Phenomenal.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> At the moment. But without getting bogged down with that, yes I ended up sort of taking on another one of James's products and then we sort of got separated along the way, and now I run local jobs and mobile web as part of the core funnel at Freelancer, and James still runs our mobile group.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Yes, so we work together quite a lot just because of that natural sort of--</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Relationship.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Yes, exactly. We've been going for quite a long time, so we want to sort of wrap it up.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Thanks for tuning into episode one.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> That was just a bit of a ramble about James and I and sort of how this all started but yes, we actually weren't intending on doing all of that, we were just going to say hi and whatever. But look, I mean hopefully, the guests are going to be far more interesting than us, so we're going to look forward to doing this sort of once a week or once every couple of weeks. We need to get some super interesting guests and tackle some super interesting topics as well. And that's about it. That's the prodcast. So, yes look guys I hope you've enjoyed listening to that, and you know the future prodcast will definitely probably drill down into more content a bit more, but yes we are super excited to be doing this and if anyone is interested in getting involved in any way please reach out to us.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> Even if it's just pushing that little subscribe button.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> That, yes.</p>
<p><strong>James 2:</strong> It would mean the world to us just to know that like one guy out there or girl or baby or horse is interested in the shit that we're talking about. It would mean a lot to us.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:</strong> Yes, absolutely. So yes, that's it guys, we hope you join us with our first ever guest actually I think we've got a couple of really exciting guests the first couple because we want to make them super useful for everybody, we'll see you guys there, hope you enjoyed it.</p>
